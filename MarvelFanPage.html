        Marvel comics was founded in 1939 as Timely Comics due to the rise in
        popularity of comic books. It would later become known as Marvel Comics
        after a brief period as Atlas Magazines. With the arrival of DC Comics,
        the industry saw competition between the two companies throughout the
        rest of the 20th century. During this period, and for nearly 60 years,
        Stanley Lieber worked at Marvel. We know him as Stan Lee, and he is
        responsible for may of my favorite heroes. Later, after going through a
        bankruptcy, the company emerged as Marvel Studios, expanding it's market
        coverage into cinematics. Eventually, Marvel Studios would be bought out
        by Walt Disney Company.

        Marvel Entertainment Group was formed in 1986. Soon after, it began to
        partner with several businesses and began purchasing small companies
        that were aligned with its goals of increasing sales and footprint. As
        mentioned previously, it would go through a rough patch, but emerge to
        become even more successful. After being bought by Disney, in 2009,
        Marvel Entertainment became a global powerhouse. There are now several
        subsidaries of Marvel, and it seems to still be growing. Anyway, here is
        a list of my favorite heroes to come out of a comics company of such
        humble beginnings.
